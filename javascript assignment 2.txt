1. Declaration: You are declaring that something exists, such as a class, function or variable. You don't say anything about what that class or function looks like, you just say that it exists.


2. Definition: You define how something is implemented, such as a class, function or variable, i.e. you say what it actually is.


3. Initialization: is the means of assigning an initial value to a variable. So undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.
